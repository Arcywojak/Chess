# Project deployed [HERE](https://my-chesss.netlify.app/).

### What helped me to do this project:
1) Initial project with Hello Roman (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMcFPl4Ujhc);
2) Chess openings from https://github.com/hayatbiralem/eco.json;
3) Artlicle about chess algorithm from https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/simple-chess-ai-step-by-step-1d55a9266977/;
4) My interest of chess;
5) Desire to have a nice project;
  
### TO_DO:  
 -clean code (possible to some extent);  
 -repair error during castling (it only appears in console but app works);  
 -make AI smarter and faster (I am too dumb to improve that at this moment);  
 -load position according to pgn (also from FEN if it was done);  
 -and I do not have more ideas currently;
